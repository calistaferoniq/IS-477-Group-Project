# Status Report

## Project Plan Task Updates

We successfully completed and submitted our full Project Plan in Github repo and Canvas and have received feedback to which we will address in this report. We acquired the job market datasets as described in the plan and have documented methods and access. The data storage strategy has been established with clear naming and consistent record conventions. We have begun the data assessment including data cleaning which will lead us into data integration and enrichment. At the time of this report, we have not completed data integration. As such, progress will need to be made before we begin model building, automation, and reproducibility tasks. 

## Updated Timeline

| Week            | Task                                                                                           | Status        | Due Date            |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Week 3 (Oct 7)  | Complete and submit the full Project Plan (ProjectPlan.md) in the GitHub repo and Canvas.     | Completed  | Oct 7, 2025         |
| Week 4-6        | Acquire job market datasets as described in the plan, thoroughly document methods, licenses, and access. | Completed  | Oct 14-28, 2025     |

| Week 14         | Document reproducibility instructions, update all data documentation, finalize visualizations/analysis outputs. | Not started  | Dec 9, 2025         |
| Week 15 (Dec 10)| Final project report and artifacts submitted on GitHub, tagged release, and Canvas submission. | Not started  | Dec 10, 2025        |

## Changes to Project Plan

**Datasets**: This project employs 2 synthetic datasets from Kaggle relating AI adoption and the job market. Both synthetic datasets are in the public domain and are intended to be used for educational purposes. While we did explore datasets from potentially more reliable sources, we did not find any widely available datasets that were appropriate for use in our research context. As such, these datasets from Kaggle based on real-world trends were the best alternative solution. However, this does mean that the findings from our analysis can not be definitively used for real-world application, but it can provide overarching insights into broader AI adoption and job market trends.

**Gaps**: In order to complete tasks from week 13-15, we need further insight into course concepts such as workflow automation, metadata standards, reproducibility methods. As we progress in this class, we will be able to better meet these needs and close potential knowledge gaps for this project.
